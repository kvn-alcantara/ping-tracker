# ping-tracker
The application will take a range of IP addresses or a list of hostnames as input and concurrently attempt to ping or establish a simple TCP connection (e.g., to a common port like 80 or 443) to each target. The terminal will display a live, updating list of hosts and their current status (e.g., "Scanning...", "Up", "Down", "Timeout").
